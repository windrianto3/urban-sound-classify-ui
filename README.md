# Urban Sound Classifier UI

Developed with React.js and TailwindCSS
  
## About
This is a React.js UI frontend that acts as an interface for the [Urban Sound Classify API](https://github.com/windrianto3/urban-sound-classify-api) that serves a Keras classifier. 
The user can obtain prediction results of the sound files in this interface by uploading a file, and then viewing the rendered results returned by the server. 

In this interface, the user can upload a sound file (MP3 or WAV) which will send an HTTP request to the server. The server will perform classification and return the predicted class of the sound file to the user.
